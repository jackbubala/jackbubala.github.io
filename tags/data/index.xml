      <description>A couple of months ago the Bears finished with a mediocre at best 8-8 season and a first-round exit in the playoffs against the Saints. Now after proving to the McCaskey’s that they are worthy of their jobs, Ryan Pace and Matt Nagy have been given, hopefully, one last chance to bring the franchicse back to it’s success in 2018. The success they had in 1985 or even 2006 would be much more appreciated though.</description>
