<p>We want Bama! That has been the call of underdog teams for years, ever since Nick Saban took over the Alabama Crimson Tide football team and made them into the the powerhouse they are today. Watch any episode of College Gameday from the past few years and you’re bound to see someone holding a sign claiming the school hosting Gameday could hang with the roll with the Tide. However, this isn’t about Alabama this is about the teams who haven’t been able to find success and the underdog who never got their chance to show the world just how good they were on college football’s biggest stage.</p>
<p>Around late 2017 those calls for Bama saw a bit of a dip as a team from Orlando was making its name as the best team in the state beating out the legendary programs of Florida, Florida State, and Miami. Now when you watched Gameday, signs shifted from We Want Bama to We Want UCF. For this project I will be looking at the combined 25-1 run of UCF in 2017 and 2018 and see if they truly were good enough to make the College Football Playoffs. I will also look at 2017 Oklahoma, 2018 Oklahoma, and 2018 Notre Dame to see if those three teams deserved the playoff spots they got over the Knights of UCF.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, UCF was most certainly an good team offensively in 2017. However, they struggled weren’t quite as good as the offensive powerhouse in the Big 12, Oklahoma. Mayfield and crew took their conference by storm offensively, but this was expected, the Big 12 has been known since the start of the century as offense-first conference. Now, we will look and see if the Knights’ defense did them any favors in the battle over the Sooners.</p>

UCF had a good front seven in 2017, however the secondary wasn’t able to follow suit. The Knights were a touch above average when it came to stopping the run as they surrendered just over 2,000 yards on the ground. However, UCF gave up nearly 3,500 yards through the air in 2017, that doesn’t look good when they aren’t even playing in a Power 5 Conference.</p>
<p>Now, we will shift our attention to 2018. After a 13-0 season concluding with a Peach Bowl victory against Auburn, UCF fans felt that another undefeated season would be enough to land them a playoff spot. That undefeated season ended up happening, but UCF was once again on the outside looking in while Notre Dame and Oklahoma made the playoffs. In our next two scatterplots we will look to see if the committee was justified in leaving the Knights out over the two blue bloods or if this was just another case of bias in college football.</p>

UCF got a lot better in 2018 when it came to rushing, however they did see a decline in their passing, likely due to Mckenzie Milton’s horrific injury in late November. They ran the ball just as well as Oklahoma, but were outdone when it came to passing. A healthy Kyler Murray is likely the reason why the Sooners were able to throw the ball all over their competition. There’s another team on this chart now as Notre Dame made it to the playoffs after going 12-0. Despite the great record and fairly impressive margin of victory, their call to the playoffs was met with waves of criticism. Many fans, UCF included, felt that the Irish didn’t deserve to be in because they weren’t in a conference. The stats here seem to back that claim. Not only did UCF pass for more yards, they also ran the ball far better than Notre Dame. Based off these stats alone, it would appear that UCF should’ve been in the playoffs over Notre Dame. However, a Notre Dame fan like myself knows that the Irish have always been more of a defensive team, especially under Brian Kelly. Now, we will examine another scatterplot in which we see how these 3 teams did defensively in 2018.</p>

The Irish made up for their bad offense with good defense. They were well above average in both stopping the run and the pass. Oklahoma got better at stopping the run, but struggled mightily in their secondary, surrendering the most passing yards of any team in 2018, and by a wide margin. UCF improved in their pass defense but gave up a lot more on the ground likely due to the loss of Shaquem Griffin. Through these four charts it’s very hard to tell whether or not UCF deserved a playoff spot in either year. It’s important to consider though that we are only looking at passing and rushing yards in these plots, and two factors just isn’t a high enough number to consider the overall ability of a team. So, I will now be comparing UCF’s 2017 team vs their 2018 team using the two t’s; touchdowns and takeaways. I will then take a closer look at one of those years, whichever year I deem to be their better year, and will determine whether they deserved to make the playoffs over the team or teams that arguably stole the Knights’ spot. For this first chart, I will be using stacked bar chart to compare the two squads</p>

As we see here, the 2017 UCF team outscored the 2018 squad and had just a few less takeaways, that combined with their stellar passing offense lead by McKenzie Milton, and their run stoppage lead by Shaqueem Griffin, these Knights were definitely better under Scott Frost. Now the big question, did this 2017 team deserve a spot in the playoffs? Well for starters, normally the Group of 5 team claims they should’ve made it in over the team that didn’t win their conference. Normally there’s one of those every year, and in 2017 it was Alabama. Here’s the problem with that, Alabama won the title in 2017, so it wouldn’t be fair to say they shouldn’t have made it because obviously they were the best team. Georgia was the team that lost to Alabama and Georgia beat Oklahoma in Pasadena in the semis to get to the championship. By that logic, that would mean Oklahoma was the least qualified team there, and they are who UCF fans targeted when claiming they should’ve made the playoffs. Now, we take a look at that 2017 Oklahoma and 2017 UCF team again. This time, we will use Yards Per Play, Yards Per Game and Total Yards on both offense and defense in order to show a sort of game-by-game comparison of the teams and we will create two bubble charts to show that.</p>

So it appears that neither team was something special on defense. From the chart above the decision appears to be too close to call so I will be using an offensive bubble chart to help decide who deserved that final spot in 2017.</p>

As seen from the chart above, both teams were exceptional at offense, however Oklahoma was nearly off the chart because of how uch offense they had. Looking at all the data we have seen throughout this post, the choice is obvious, UCF did not deserve to make the playoffs. Yes they were great in 2017 and they were good in 2018 too, but the Knights just couldn’t compete with the best of the best. UCF may have claimed the title in 2017 but they were far from the best team in the nation. Baker Mayfield won the Heisman and was the #1 draft choice for a reason, he made Oklahoma the powerhouse that dominated the Big 12 in the late half of the 2010s. Yes, the committee does have its flaws, but they made the right choice here in not allowing selction sunday to be a knight to remember for UCF fans.</p>
